                                <h2 class="subtitle is-6">By Jonah Gann</h2>
                                <h5>
                                    How Does the Book Differ from the Movie?
                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    Once Percy makes it to camp in the movie, they reveal that Percy Jackson is Posidon’s
                                    son, because he built Percy a little house at the camp with tridents as decoration.
                                    While in the book, no one knows that Percy is Posidon’s son until a trident, made
                                    from water, floats above Percy’s head to protect him against a bully, named Clarissa.
                                    Clarissa was breaking the rules in Capture the Flag. In the movie this does not
                                    happen and Clarissa does not appear.

                                </p>
                                <p>Later, Luke, one of the camp counselors, gives Percy, Grover, and Annabeth a map to
                                    each pearl they needed to escape the underworld later when they got there. This
                                    does not happen in the book. After that, Luke gives Percy a pair of flying shoes
                                    and a shield. In the book Percy gets the flying shoes but he doesn’t end up using
                                    them, instead Grover does. Also in the book, Luke never gives them a shield.</p>
                                <p>In the movie, they go on a quest and follow the map to get the pearls, while in the
                                    book, Percy is given the pearls by a water person sent by Posidon, and they just
                                    go to the locations on the way to the underworld.
                                </p>
                                <p>The next difference, in the film, they go to a museum to get a pearl that is in a
                                    statue, but a hydra is guarding it and they fight the hydra. In the book, none of
                                    this happens, and instead they fight a Chimera on a tower and Percy jumps off it
                                    from very high into some water. Also, in the book, there is an entire bus fight scene
                                    with the three furies; in the
                                    movie none of this happens. Another difference is that in the book, Ares hides the
                                    lightning bolt in Percy’s backpack instead of Luke hiding it in Percy’s shield
                                    at the beginning of the movie. In the movie, Ares does not appear.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the book, where Medusa appears, Medusa disguises herself as a nice lady and gives Percy, Grover, and Annabeth delicious food. In the movie, she is immediately revealed as Medusa and does not serve food. One major difference is that when Percy saves his mom she stays behind, but in the movie, instead Grover stays behind.</p>
                                <p>After they defeat Medusa in the book, they send Medusa’s head to Olympus, and at the end of the book, they ship it back to Percy’s house and his mom uses it to turn Percy’s abusive stepdad, Gabe, into a statue and she sells it. In the movie this does not happen and Percy’s mom just kicks Gabe out. In conclusion, these are the main differences that I have taken note of between the movie and the book of Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.</p>
                                <h5>What couldn’t have been removed from the book in the movie because it would ruin the main idea?
                                </h5>
                                <p>One part of the story that couldn’t have been removed from the book in the movie because it would ruin the main idea is if Percy’s mom had not been captured. The two reasons this would not work is that, first, it would get rid of the motivation that Percy has on this quest, and they would not have to go to Hades.
                                </p>

                                <p>There was a girl named Sophie who lived with her dad. Her mom left to go save the
                                    world
                                    when she was 7. About 5 years later, Sophie played video games with her friend,
                                    Stuart.
                                    She met Stu while sitting on the swings at recess. He was all alone, but then she
                                    gave
                                    him her iPad and he played Minecraft.</p>

                                <p>Stu had a step brother named Lucas. One day, they were playing a game called
                                    “Camelot’s
                                    Honor”. They had finally gotten to the last boss in the game, Morganna. They tried
                                    once
                                    and failed. Also, they played with an online player named, Sir Melvin.</p>

                                <p>Lucas liked soccer and Stu wanted to do soccer because he wanted to make his father
                                    proud (because there was a pizza party).
                                    They couldn't play for like a week. A bit later, Sophie got an email from a random
                                    person. It took her to a link. There were some words on it. Then, she read them out
                                    loud.</p>

                                <p>She was taken back in time, and when she saw a boy whose name was Arthur she was
                                    shocked. He took her to a wizard named Merlin. THE Merlin. She was super surprised
                                    that
                                    she asked him if the text had to do anything with him. He said that he did text her
                                    and
                                    he was Sir Melvin. She was incredibly surprised and thought “I played with Merlin?!
                                    Am I
                                    dreaming?!” but she was not dreaming. Merlin needed her to get the scabbard that
                                    Guinevere dropped in the Well of Dreams. They needed someone to get it, so they got
                                    Sophie.
                                    But Arthur went and got it anyway, without telling anybody. Then, when they realized
                                    he
                                    had left, they sent Stu a text. He came and he was disguised as Arthur until the
                                    real
                                    Arthur came back.</p>

                                <p>Arthur went through and he came out on the side of a road. A truck driver saw him and
                                    asked him if he wanted a lift. He said yes, probably not knowing what a truck was.
                                    The
                                    truck driver brought him to a theater called Medieval Manor where he met Lucas,
                                    Stu’s
                                    step brother. He said he was looking for Stu and asked Arthur to help. They talked
                                    about
                                    where Arthur came from because Lucas never saw him before and Arthur said he was
                                    from
                                    Britain. The next day, Arthur went to school as an exchange student from Britain. He
                                    found the scabbard a bit later. Mr. Moony took it from him for the rest of the day
                                    because it looked like a weapon. Lucas helped convince him to give it back at the
                                    end of
                                    the day.</p>

                                <p>Sophie and Stu were at the “who can pull the sword out of the stone” competition.
                                    Some
                                    men went, then it was Stu’s turn. He did it! Sophie used magic powers that she
                                    didn’t
                                    know she had. Everybody celebrated and Guinevere was super happy for Arthur. She
                                    waved
                                    to him but Stu didn’t respond. Later, Lot challenged him to a duel. But Stu was not
                                    going to bring a sword he was gonna bring a gun that he made. He knew how to make
                                    one
                                    because once Lucas and Stu made a gun.</p>

                                <p>Lucas and Arthur were at the football game and Lucas went out on the field. A bit
                                    later
                                    it was almost the end of the game but Lucas hurt himself so Arthur dressed up as
                                    Lucas
                                    and he scored! They all celebrated they had won the game! But a guy named Mortimor
                                    was
                                    going to play if Arthur wasn't there, so he got mad.</p>

                                <p>At night, Guinevere came to Arthur's room and she woke Stu, while holding a sword to
                                    his
                                    neck, and said “Who are you, and what did you do to the real Arthur.” Stu was
                                    hesitant.
                                    “What do you mean?” he said, wondering if she found out that he was a fake. He told
                                    her
                                    that he was filling in for Athur. She left while thinking it was all her fault. If
                                    she
                                    didn’t drop the scabbard, this never would've happened. She then went through the
                                    Well
                                    of Dreams to go find Arthur.</p>

                                <p>At the dual, Stu was getting his gun loaded but he was thrown into the wall. He tried
                                    getting the lighter, but he was knocked into the wall again. Finally, he got it and
                                    shot
                                    King Lot
                                    and then sent Lot to jail.</p>

                                <p>When she came out, she was in a football field and Arthur in his football suit saw
                                    Guinevere sitting in the field. He came over and asked her why she was here. She
                                    told
                                    him he has to come back. But he refuses because he likes it in the 21st century. He
                                    leaves and Lucas comes. Then Sophie comes back and Guinevere lives with Sophie.
                                    Sometime
                                    later Sophie asks Lucas to show Arthur the game, Camelot’s Honor. Later he shows it
                                    to
                                    Arthur, and he says it's about KING Arthur. Next, Arthur google's “King Arthur” and
                                    he
                                    sees that Guinevere betrays him.</p>

                                <p>Stu sees a lady floating in a river who is screaming for help. He goes to see her and
                                    he
                                    saves her, but she was mad because she wanted a different person that was standing
                                    on
                                    the bridge but by then he had walked away. He said he was King Arthur but she did
                                    not
                                    believe him because the spell washed off and now he looked like normal old Stu. But
                                    she
                                    was happy that he saved her so she wanted to help him because he saved her life.</p>

                                <p>Later Sophie’s dad asked what type of pizza Sophie and Guinevere wanted. Sophie said
                                    pepperoni, but her dad had no idea what that was. So she said cheese. She thought
                                    that
                                    the timeline had messed up and that pepperoni pizza is gone!</p>

                                <p>Morgana came and was looking for the scabbard when she saw Mortimer. She asked him
                                    where
                                    he was. She said she didn't like him and he said the same. So Morgana had an
                                    assistant.
                                    Then the school went to find Stu. Lucas and Guinevere snuck away to get a smoothie.
                                    They
                                    got the smoothie and they kissed. Then Guinevere said that she belonged to Arthur.
                                    Secretly, someone had recorded them.</p>

                                <p>At school everybody saw the recording and was laughing. Then Arthur saw the video and
                                    got mad and ran away and Lucas followed him. Guinevere was captured by Morgana and
                                    Mortimer was the one who had posted the video. He told Lucas and Arthur and they
                                    were
                                    mad at him. Sophie saw her mother, and found out that she was a “Companion,” which
                                    was a
                                    person with magic. Then, Arthur and Lucas told Sophie that Guinevere was captured.
                                    They
                                    were confused who the Adult was. Sophie told them it was her mom. But, they needed
                                    Merlin so they went to his cave.</p>

                                <p>When they got there, they met up with Stu and the girl who he saved. They went to his
                                    cave but Merlin was not there. They saw his computer and gmail was open and someone
                                    texted him. She was mad at him and she wanted to meet up with him at a certain
                                    location
                                    of where he and her met up. Then they went there. The girl that Stu saved freed
                                    Merlin
                                    and they went to Morgana’s fortress. While Arthur and Lucas had a plan to stop the
                                    Saxsons. Sophie and the others fought Morgana. Mid fight Sophie transformed into a
                                    hawk!
                                    Finally, they defeated her!</p>

                                <p>Nimue was running from Morganna. She ran away and went to Merlin's cave to get Merlin
                                    to give Arthur the Holy Grail because Arthur was sick and the Holy Grail had healing
                                    powers so it could heal him. But when she went he was not there. Then she met
                                    Emerys, Merlin's new apprentice and she wanted him to give the holy grail to Arthur.
                                    But then, some guards were coming to check on merlin so they disguised themselves as
                                    chefs and they turned the holy grail into a chicken and put it in a pot. They said
                                    to the guards that they were just cooking chicken for dinner for when Merlin came
                                    back, so the guards left. But now the Grail was a chicken and they didn't know how
                                    to turn it back so they contacted the companions.</p>

                                <p>Sophie was getting ready for the wedding with her dad and Ashley’s mom but then she
                                    got the alert and went back in time but Ashley accidentally went with her and they
                                    went. Stu was about to move away but he didn’t want to tell Sophie because she would
                                    get disappointed.</p>

                                <p>
                                    When they went through she and Ashley talked to Nimue and Emerys. Then they figured
                                    out
                                    Merlin went to las vegas. Emerys accidentally turned the chicken into a dragon,
                                    which
                                    Ashley named Spike. They went and got Stu. Next, they flew to Las Vegas. They
                                    dressed
                                    Spike up like a dog then when they got there they went to the Hotel “Excalibur” that
                                    was
                                    where Merlin was. They found him at a play that he was in!
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Next, they went to a different play and Morganna was there. They fought her and
                                    Emerys
                                    and Nimue came! They Banished Morgana to a different world, but she probably was
                                    gonna
                                    come back. Merlin opened a portal to the land of Faerie to get a plant. It is used
                                    for a
                                    spell to make Spike a Holy Grail again. The kids made it through but Merlin was
                                    caught
                                    by some guards. The kids went to the castle. They were crossing a bridge and Stu
                                    told
                                    Sophie that he was moving. When they got there they gave the Queen the skin cream
                                    they
                                    got from Las Vegas. She liked it and was going to give them the cream but then
                                    Morgana
                                    came in and chased them. Then, Merlin came because Nimue and Emery rescued him from
                                    the
                                    guards. And he defeated Morgana and they got the plant. They went back and gave The
                                    Holy
                                    Grail to Arthur.

                                <p>
                                    The children, Henry, Benny, Violet, and Jessie, had an exciting summer ahead of them and
                                    it started with a knock on the door. Mr. Alden, their grandfather, was at the door. He
                                    walked in and went to the front room and slammed the door. Benny thought, “What was
                                    wrong with Grandfather?” Benny said that something bad must have happened. Usually he
                                    says, “How are you today?” but all he said was “Hello.” Jessie called for Henry and they
                                    told him about grandfather. He wondered “What happened that made him act that way?
                                    Something must be wrong!” They went and talked to him.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Grandfather said that he got a letter from his sister. The children did not know that he
                                    had a sister. She lived out West on a ranch. He said that his sister, named Jane, was an
                                    old, cross woman. The neighbor who stays with her was going to leave and she would be
                                    all alone. Grandfather would not let that happen. Benny said, “Why can’t you go stay
                                    with her?” Grandfather said that Jane does not like him, so she would not let him in. He
                                    said that she had a neighbor named Maggie.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Then, the girls said that they would take care of Jane, so they went on a train. While
                                    on the train, a mysterious man said that he would take their luggage out of the train.
                                    Then he did. When they got there, they met Maggie. Over the days ahead, Jane was less
                                    cross and liked them more. One day, Jessie made some eggs and Maggie, Violet, and Jessie
                                    ate them. The extra eggs she mashed up and added orange juice. Jane really liked it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The girls missed Henry and Benny. So, they asked Jane if they could come. Jane said yes.
                                    So the boys and Watch, the dog, came to the ranch. Jane liked Watch and the boys.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Jane said that her birthday was soon. The children went on a walk through the woods.
                                    They saw a little hut with a campfire and they also saw yellow and black striped rocks.
                                    And if you dropped them they would explode into dust. Then, they went home.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Sam came with milk the next day and he was surprised to see the children so early. They
                                    asked if he could show them how to take care of the chickens. He was glad to show them
                                    how to feed the chickens, get them water, and collect the eggs.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The children said that aunt Jane was going to give them the ranch, and Sam was
                                    surprised. They told Jane about the hut and she was surprised because she did not know
                                    about the hut. They went with Sam to the hut and he saw the hut and the stones. He said
                                    that the stones were used for indian paintings. Then, they went back.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It was Jane's birthday and the children asked Jane if grandfather could come. She said
                                    yes. So grandfather came. Then, the mysterious man came and grandfather said that he
                                    would be there handy man on the ranch. Jane got into a dress and they had a party. And
                                    the kids got the ranch.
                                </p>
