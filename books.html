                                <h2 class="subtitle is-6">By Jonah Gann</h2>
                                <h5>
                                    How Does the Book Differ from the Movie?
                                </h5>
                                <p>
                                    Once Percy makes it to camp in the movie, they reveal that Percy Jackson is
                                    Posidon’s
                                    son, because he built Percy a little house at the camp with tridents as decoration.
                                    While in the book, no one knows that Percy is Posidon’s son until a trident, made
                                    from water, floats above Percy’s head to protect him against a bully, named
                                    Clarissa.
                                    Clarissa was breaking the rules in Capture the Flag. In the movie this does not
                                    happen and Clarissa does not appear.
                                </p>
                                <p>Later, Luke, one of the camp counselors, gives Percy, Grover, and Annabeth a map to
                                    each pearl they needed to escape the underworld later when they got there. This
                                    does not happen in the book. After that, Luke gives Percy a pair of flying shoes
                                    and a shield. In the book Percy gets the flying shoes but he doesn’t end up using
                                    them, instead Grover does. Also in the book, Luke never gives them a shield.</p>
                                <p>In the movie, they go on a quest and follow the map to get the pearls, while in the
                                    book, Percy is given the pearls by a water person sent by Posidon, and they just
                                    go to the locations on the way to the underworld.
                                </p>
                                <p>The next difference, in the film, they go to a museum to get a pearl that is in a
                                    statue, but a hydra is guarding it and they fight the hydra. In the book, none of
                                    this happens, and instead they fight a Chimera on a tower and Percy jumps off it
                                    from very high into some water. Also, in the book, there is an entire bus fight
                                    scene
                                    with the three furies; in the
                                    movie none of this happens. Another difference is that in the book, Ares hides the
                                    lightning bolt in Percy’s backpack instead of Luke hiding it in Percy’s shield
                                    at the beginning of the movie. In the movie, Ares does not appear.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the book, where Medusa appears, Medusa disguises herself as a nice lady and gives
                                    Percy, Grover, and Annabeth delicious food. In the movie, she is immediately
                                    revealed as Medusa and does not serve food. One major difference is that when Percy
                                    saves his mom she stays behind, but in the movie, instead Grover stays behind.</p>
                                <p>After they defeat Medusa in the book, they send Medusa’s head to Olympus, and at the
                                    end of the book, they ship it back to Percy’s house and his mom uses it to turn
                                    Percy’s abusive stepdad, Gabe, into a statue and she sells it. In the movie this
                                    does not happen and Percy’s mom just kicks Gabe out. In conclusion, these are the
                                    main differences that I have taken note of between the movie and the book of Percy
                                    Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.</p>
                                <h5>What couldn’t have been removed from the book in the movie because it would ruin the
                                    main idea?
                                </h5>
                                <p>One part of the story that couldn’t have been removed from the book in the movie
                                    because it would ruin the main idea is if Percy’s mom had not been captured. The two
                                    reasons this would not work is that, first, it would get rid of the motivation that
                                    Percy has on this quest, and they would not have to go to Hades.

                                <h1 class="title is-4">Language as a Tool for Social Control in “The Giver”</h1>
                                <p>Language is used as a tool for social control in "The Giver". Certain words are
                                    distorted from the meaning that we attribute to them and are used to promote the
                                    rules and conventions of the community. Some of these words include, "release",
                                    "birth mother", and "assignment". In this essay, I will show how these words are
                                    being used as tools for social control.</p>
                                <p>In "The Giver" they use the term "release” on several occasions. One example is when
                                    a set of twins were born, they didn’t want two people to look the same. If they
                                    looked the same it would indicate that they were siblings and the familial bond
                                    could threaten allegiance to the community. This word in "The Giver" is at first
                                    implied as going to a new place, but then is later to be revealed as death. The
                                    reason they use it this way is to soften the difficult and upsetting implications so
                                    people won’t get angry, sad, or rebel. The word "release" in real life means to let
                                    something go or to move on. In "The Giver" they use the word "release" so people
                                    won’t get sad when the community chooses to exterminate babies, the elderly, or
                                    rebels.</p>
                                <p>Another example of language being used as a tool for social control in "The Giver" is
                                    "birth mother". "Birth mothers" in "The Giver" are people who are used to create
                                    “new children”, but these birth mothers don’t raise the children. In real life,
                                    "birth mothers" are important leaders and members in family life, not just people
                                    who give birth. In "The Giver" they say it is not a very honored "assignment" to be
                                    a “birth mother” because they have three children each and then are useless for the
                                    remainder of their lives, without further “assignment.”</p>
                                <p>The next word is "assignment" and is used in "The Giver" to mean “job” but instead of
                                    having a choice, they are assigned their roles in society. When people turn 12, they
                                    get assigned their “assignment” at a ceremony. This shows that the community
                                    controls people and what they do with their lives.
                                </p>
                                <p>This has been my essay on how language is used as a tool for social control in "The
                                    Giver" Including some words that are different from their real world meanings and
                                    how they control people, and examples of this happening.

                                <h6>Examine the numerous setbacks Salva experiences. How does he respond, and what does
                                    this tell the readers about his character?</h6>
                                <p>Salva experiences several setbacks throughout the book and they seem to serve to
                                    strengthen his character. The first setback that Salva experiences is when his
                                    village gets attacked while he is at school and is told to run to the bush. In this
                                    situation he is worrying about his family. This shows that Salva cares for others.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another setback that Salva experiences is when he is traveling his best friend dies
                                    from a lion attack. Salva becomes motivated by this because he realizes his best
                                    friend would have wanted him to continue on and survive the long trip.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Salva’s uncle reconnected with him when he joined the group of people traveling to
                                    the emergency camp. This gives Salva hope that his family might still be alive, and
                                    it shows that Salva is a positive person.
                                </p>
                                <p>Later, Salva’s uncle gets shot by cruel men from the other tribe. This makes him have
                                    a strong desire to meet up with the rest of his family and motivates him to keep on
                                    going. When he finally gets to the emergency camp, people fire guns and scare them
                                    away. Salva then led a group of boys to another camp where they would be safe. This
                                    shows that Salva is a leader, even in the worst of times.</p>
                                <p>Further on in the story, Salva gets picked as a person that gets to go to America. He
                                    uses his time in America to start a charity that builds wells for people that have
                                    to walk a long way for clean water and builds schools where he is from. This shows
                                    that Salva makes good use of privileged and special opportunities. In the end, Salva
                                    finds his Mom and Dad. Everything he did was worth it.

                                <p>
                                    In the beginning of the book, Thomas starts out as a frustrated newcomer, but
                                    undergoes a transformation into the main leader of the group of the “Gladers.” The
                                    events that led the other “Gladers” to trust and respect his character also invest
                                    the reader, as Thomas proves himself throughout the book.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the start of the story, Thomas is angry and confused, but eventually begins
                                    getting to know the other boys around the Glade. Thomas is very curious about the
                                    Maze and gets an urge to become a runner in the Maze, which is not a common thing
                                    for people to want because it is very dangerous. Little was known about the Maze,
                                    but there was a general belief among the “Gladers” that there was a way out through
                                    the Maze and that it could be solved. This is the driving motivation that made
                                    Thomas want to be a runner, so he could get himself, and the “Gladers” out of the
                                    Glade and into the real world. This shows that Thomas wanted to lead so he could
                                    save everyone in the Glade.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Around the middle of the book, a girl named Teresa appears. Thomas and Teresa can
                                    communicate to each other telepathically. This motivates Thomas to think that he has
                                    a special power that can help with the mystery of the Maze. Thomas’s motivation and
                                    knowledge make him qualified as a good leader for the group.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the end of the book, Thomas sees a connection between the shape of the Maze as a
                                    clue to getting out. The runners had made a map of the Maze and he saw that the
                                    aerial view of the shape spells out words. He realizes those words can be used as
                                    codes that they can type into a computer that is in the “griever hole,” where the
                                    monsters come out and into the maze. Thomas convinces the others that there is a way
                                    out of the Maze through the “griever hole” and convinces the other boys to follow
                                    him which was not an easy task. Not all of the boys follow Thomas, but many do and
                                    eventually they escape the maze through his plan.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All of this shows how Thomas begins his journey as a confused newcomer, and later
                                    becomes a confident leader and guides others out of the maze through embracing his
                                    abilities and beliefs.

                                    Rob Hall is introduced as a great leader in the beginning of Into Thin Air. Do the
                                    events of the story reinforce that description or undermine it? Use specific
                                    examples to support your claim.
                                </h6>
                                <p>
                                    While Rob Hall is introduced as a great leader, he is proven further along in the
                                    story to be susceptible to weaknesses and ultimately makes mistakes that lead to his
                                    demise. Up until chapter 11, none of the climbers die and Hall is doing a great job
                                    as a leader. But then, one after another, people begin to die from falls, frostbite,
                                    and other injuries. This shows that he is less of a good leader, especially in this
                                    trip to Everest, further in the book, even though on past climbs he led groups
                                    without the loss of life. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another example of Rob Hall being a leader with shortcomings, is that he falls into
                                    a crevasse and gets stuck. This leads to many sherpas and climbers dying attempting
                                    to save him. This further proves that Rob Hall was inadequate as a leader for this
                                    trip, even though he appears to be a strong leader when he is introduced.
                                    Unfortunately the leaders on the trip were not prepared for the rapid change in
                                    weather. </p>
                                <h6>
                                    What did you learn from this book concerning human ambition and how do you think the
                                    guides and climbers could have changed the outcome of the events?
                                </h6>
                                <p>
                                    In my opinion, I think climbing Mount Everest is very ambitious. The chances that
                                    you will die are pretty high, and the chances that you will get frostbite or a major
                                    injury is extremely high. It also takes tons of hard work and dedication, and a lot
                                    of training beforehand. I can see why someone would want to climb it as a life goal
                                    to feel proud of themselves, but in the end I don’t think it is worth it unless you
                                    have a passion for climbing. I don’t personally think I would climb it myself. </p>
                                <p>
                                    I would say the best way to change the events that happened would be to not climb
                                    the mountain at all. It would prevent a lot of deaths and injuries. If you were to
                                    climb it anyways I think they should have been more cautious, prepared, and kept
                                    track of people better so they didn’t leave them behind without knowing it.

                                    Lewis deliberately portrays Hell as a much more ordinary and less physically
                                    tormenting place than other representations of Hell in popular culture and religious
                                    art. Did his version strike you as more or less haunting than the common portrayal
                                    of Hell as a fiery torture zone? Why?
                                </h6>
                                <p>The way Lewis portrays Hell is less physically tormenting and I strike it as less
                                    haunting, but it seems like what life on Earth is like, which can feel like torture
                                    because if you lived forever on Earth, it would become repetitive and boring,
                                    becoming an eternal torture.

                                <h6>Just as Lewis portrays Hell differently than most depictions in popular culture and
                                    religious art, he also portrays Heaven differently. While Heaven is often
                                    represented as a particularly ethereal place, full of clouds and floating angels,
                                    Lewis represents it as a place of remarkable solidity, so hard to the touch that
                                    newcomers have to acclimate to its density. Why do you think he chose to portray
                                    Heaven this way?
                                </h6>
                                <p>I think Lewis portrayed Heaven this way to show that Heaven is like an ancient and
                                    important place that newcomers can’t tamper with. So it would make sense if CS Lewis
                                    was trying to represent heaven as something true, permanent, and everlasting.</p>
                                <h6>What do you think Lewis is saying, in this book, about the relationship between good
                                    and evil?
                                </h6>
                                <p>The relationship between good and evil in this book shows that people who keep doing
                                    bad things, can’t be with God and their family that did good things. For example,
                                    the mother couldn’t see her son because she refused God. When you allow God to take
                                    away those bad things in life, you can see God more clearly.</p>
                                <h6>If you drew one lesson from your reading of The Great Divorce, what would it be?
                                </h6>
                                <p>If I drew one lesson from my reading of The Great Divorce, it would be that if we
                                    hold something with pride, like a child, a talent, or a lust for something, then
                                    that will separate us from God, destroying our relationship.</p>
                                <h6>Is there a particular quote in the book that stood out to you or resonated with you?
                                    What is it and why did it stand out to you?
                                </h6>
                                <p>he quote that stood out to me was “All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that
                                    self-choice there could be no Hell.” This resonates with me because it is true. If
                                    everyone was set on the right path and never walked off it, you would always get to
                                    where you are going. It also shows that God is amazing because he gives us free will
                                    even though we do bad things with our free will.
